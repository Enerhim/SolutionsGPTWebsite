    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A solution is a homogeneous mixture where the composition and properties are uniform throughout. In everyday life and in nature, most substances exist as mixtures rather than pure compounds. This chapter lays the foundation for understanding the behavior, concentration, and properties of solutions—key topics in modern chemistry.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Definitions & Terms -->
    <section id="definitions">
      <h2>2. Definitions & Terms</h2>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
        A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. It consists of a solute, which is dissolved in a solvent.
      </p>
      <h3>Solvent and Solute</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Solvent:</strong> The component present in the greatest amount that determines the state (solid, liquid, or gas).<br>
        <strong>Solute:</strong> The substance dissolved in the solvent.
      </p>
      <h3>Saturated, Unsaturated, and Supersaturated Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        A <em>saturated solution</em> is one in which no more solute can dissolve at a given temperature and pressure. An <em>unsaturated solution</em> can dissolve additional solute, while a <em>supersaturated solution</em> temporarily contains more solute than it can normally dissolve.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Concentration of Solutions -->
    <section id="concentration">
      <h2>3. Concentration of Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Concentration is a measure of the amount of solute present in a given quantity of solution. There are several methods to express concentration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mass Percentage (w/w):</strong> (Mass of solute / Total mass of solution) × 100%</li>
        <li><strong>Volume Percentage (v/v):</strong> (Volume of solute / Total volume of solution) × 100%</li>
        <li><strong>Mass by Volume Percentage (w/v):</strong> Mass of solute in 100 mL of solution</li>
        <li><strong>Parts Per Million (ppm):</strong> (Mass of solute / Total mass of solution) × 10<sup>6</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Mole Fraction (x):</strong> Ratio of moles of a component to the total moles in the solution</li>
        <li><strong>Molarity (M):</strong> Moles of solute per liter of solution</li>
        <li><strong>Molality (m):</strong> Moles of solute per kilogram of solvent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that <em>molarity</em> is temperature-dependent since volume changes with temperature, whereas <em>molality</em> is based on mass and remains constant.
      </p>
      <div class="formula-box">Mass % = (mass of solute / total mass of solution) × 100</div>
      <div class="formula-box">Molarity (M) = moles of solute / volume of solution (L)</div>
      <div class="formula-box">Molality (m) = moles of solute / mass of solvent (kg)</div>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Solubility -->
    <section id="solubility">
      <h2>4. Solubility</h2>
      <p>
        Solubility is defined as the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a specified amount of solvent at a given temperature and pressure. It depends on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature of Solute and Solvent:</strong> “Like dissolves like” – polar solutes in polar solvents and nonpolar solutes in nonpolar solvents.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> For solids, solubility usually increases with temperature, whereas for gases, solubility decreases as temperature rises.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Mainly affects the solubility of gases; increased pressure generally increases gas solubility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In a saturated solution, the process of dissolution and crystallization occurs simultaneously, establishing a dynamic equilibrium.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Key Laws -->
    <section id="laws">
      <h2>5. Key Laws Governing Solutions</h2>
      
      <h3>Henry's Law</h3>
      <p>
        Henry’s Law describes the solubility of a gas in a liquid. It states that at a constant temperature, the concentration of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the solution.
      </p>
      <div class="formula-box">C = k<sub>H</sub> × P</div>
      <p>
        Where C is the concentration of the gas, k<sub>H</sub> is Henry’s law constant (which varies with the nature of the gas and solvent), and P is the partial pressure of the gas.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Raoult's Law</h3>
      <p>
        Raoult’s Law applies to ideal solutions and relates the vapor pressure of a solution to the mole fraction of the solvent. For a volatile solvent:
      </p>
      <div class="formula-box">P<sub>solvent</sub> = x<sub>solvent</sub> × P°<sub>solvent</sub></div>
      <p>
        In binary solutions (two volatile components), the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:
      </p>
      <div class="formula-box">P<sub>total</sub> = x<sub>1</sub>P°<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>P°<sub>2</sub></div>
      <p>
        Raoult’s law is a special case of Henry’s law when the proportionality constant for the solvent becomes its pure vapor pressure.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures</h3>
      <p>
        Dalton’s Law states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas:
      </p>
      <div class="formula-box">P<sub>total</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub> + ...</div>
      <p>
        In the context of solutions, it explains how the vapor phase above a solution is composed of contributions from each volatile component.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Colligative Properties -->
    <section id="colligative">
      <h2>6. Colligative Properties</h2>
      <p>
        Colligative properties depend solely on the number of solute particles in a solution and not on their nature. These properties include:
      </p>
      <h3>Relative Lowering of Vapor Pressure</h3>
      <div class="formula-box">ΔP / P° = x<sub>solute</sub></div>
      <p>
        The decrease in the vapor pressure of the solvent is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the solute.
      </p>
      <h3>Boiling Point Elevation</h3>
      <div class="formula-box">ΔT<sub>b</sub> = K<sub>b</sub> × m</div>
      <p>
        Here, K<sub>b</sub> is the ebullioscopic constant and m is the molality. Adding a solute raises the boiling point of the solution compared to the pure solvent.
      </p>
      <h3>Freezing Point Depression</h3>
      <div class="formula-box">ΔT<sub>f</sub> = K<sub>f</sub> × m</div>
      <p>
        K<sub>f</sub> is the cryoscopic constant. The presence of a solute lowers the freezing point of the solvent.
      </p>
      <h3>Osmotic Pressure</h3>
      <div class="formula-box">π = M R T</div>
      <p>
        Osmotic pressure (π) is the pressure required to stop the net flow of solvent into the solution through a semipermeable membrane, where M is the molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature (in Kelvin).
      </p>
      <p>
        These properties are vital in determining molar masses and understanding the behavior of solutions in biological and industrial processes.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Abnormal Molar Mass and van't Hoff Factor -->
    <section id="abnormal">
      <h2>7. Abnormal Molar Mass and the van't Hoff Factor</h2>
      <p>
        In many solutions, especially those containing electrolytes or associating molecules, the number of particles in solution may differ from the number originally dissolved. This leads to an "abnormal" molar mass when calculated using colligative properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The van’t Hoff factor (i) is introduced to account for dissociation or association:
      </p>
      <div class="formula-box">i = (Observed colligative effect) / (Expected colligative effect)</div>
      <p>
        For example, an electrolyte that completely dissociates (like KCl) will have an i close to 2, whereas a substance that dimerizes (such as acetic acid in benzene) may have an i less than 1.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Osmosis and Reverse Osmosis -->
    <section id="osmosis">
      <h2>8. Osmosis and Reverse Osmosis</h2>
      <p>
        Osmosis is the movement of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration. This natural process continues until equilibrium is reached.
      </p>
      <p>
        The osmotic pressure, which is the pressure required to prevent osmosis, is given by:
      </p>
      <div class="formula-box">π = C R T</div>
      <p>
        When a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure is applied, the process can be reversed—this is known as <em>reverse osmosis</em>, a widely used method for water purification and desalination.
      </p>
    </section>
